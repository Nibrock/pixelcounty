# *(COMING SOON)*
Pixel County will be a free-to-play online community with games, character and house customization, social mmo-aspects, and a site wide economy, all the in the style of pixel art.

## Planned Features

 - In-depth character customization, with consistent updates adding new clothes, hairstyles, and more.
 - A plethora of hand-made games, including games inspired by classic party, board, and card games, with both CPU play, online matchmaking, as well as private hosted lobbies for just you and your friends.
 - Economy system, with "coins" earnable through playing games, and more.
 - Global market system, where players can buy and sell items they have obtained or would like to attain, in a variable and reactive economy.
 - No micro-transactions.
    - I really want the game to be one that anyone can play and enjoy without spending hundreds on micro-transactions. Having rare items and cool skins should be a reward for players that dedicate time to a game, not those who can spend the most irl money.
 - Fishing, with hundreds of different catchable fish and items, rarities, and global leaderboards.
